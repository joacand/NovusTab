# NovusTab

A good looking homepage / new tab page with the following features:

 * Continuously changing background color depending on the time of day
 * Time and date
 * Current weather


### Installation:
Get a Forecast.io API key to get weather functionality: [https://developer.forecast.io/](https://developer.forecast.io/)  
Git pull and you are ready to go.

GeoLocation does not work when you run this locally, so you need to enter your latitude and longitude if you decide to run it locally.  
Don't forget to hide your API key using PHP or similar, if you decide to host it on the web.

### Todo:
* Add Availability to add common visited links
* Hide the API key through PHP or similar

### Thanks to:

 * [Forecast.io](https://forecast.io/) for the weather API
 * [Daniel Vierich](http://www.danvierich.de/weather/) for the free weather icons
